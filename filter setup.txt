The GERS people have used this setup several times so 
they are familiar with the process.

    A Basic Print Filter 

    The following shows the filter setup to print the checks on your printer.
    
    1. Create the filter script in a suitable directory, for example: /opt/local/bin:

		#!/bin/ksh
		#
		# /opt/local/bin/check.sh
		#
		echo "%!PS-Adobe-2.0"
		echo "(A_P01) run A_P01"
		cat -
		echo "\004"

    Remember to make this script executable; permissions 755 should be sufficient.

    2. Create the filter definition file /etc/lp/fd/check.fd. Be careful to preserve all spaces within this file:

    Input types: any
    Output types: check
    Printer types: any
    Printers: any
    Filter type: slow
    Command: /opt/local/bin/check.sh

    3. Register the filter with the lp subsystem:

    # lpfilter -f check -F /etc/lp/fd/check.fd

    The -f field needs to match the "output types" entry in the *.fd file.

    4. Create a queue with this content type:

    # lpadmin -p checks -o protocol=tcp,dest=<printer-IP>:9100 -v /dev/null -m netstandard -T unknown -I check
    # enable checks ; accept checks

    This will create a queue (checks) to a printer (which can interpret PS) to print a file as a check.
